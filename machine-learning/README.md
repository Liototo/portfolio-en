# "Introduction to machine learning" project: machine learning methods

Developed by Eliott Bell, Dmitry Teploukhov and Santhos Umabalan

Bachelor, semester 3 (sep. 2022 - jan. 2023), EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)

This project consisted in the implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms: ridge regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours and neural networks, as well as other useful techniques such as cross-validation and principal component analysis.

### What we did

In the methods/ folder, we implemented methods in the files cross_validation.py, deep_network.py, knn.py, linear_regression.py, logistic_regression.py and pca.py. We also implemented several parts of main.py, mainly the extraction of parameters.

### Developed skills

- Machine learning

- Python programming

- Understanding and appending pre-existing code

- Teamwork and organisation
