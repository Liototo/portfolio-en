# "The software enterprise - from ideas to products" project: Android application

Developed by Simone Andreani, Eliott Bell, Nizar Ben Mohamed, Chun Tzu Chang, Dmitry Teploukhov and Santhos Umabalan

Bachelor, semester 6 (feb. 2024 - jul. 2024), EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)

This project's aim was to give us an idea of how software development is organised in professional contexts. We followed the Scrum method, with eleven one-week sprints, each including multiple team meetings and one meeting with TAs.

During this project, we developed StepQuest, an Android application turning a step counter into a social challenge. Users can add friends, send them challenges, or create and follow routes using a GPS service. Each successful challenge earns the user some points, allowing players to compete with friends and users all over the world.

### What we did

We coded all the Kotlin files in the StepQuest/app/src folder. We also implemented connectivity to a Firebase database. A large chunk of our workload was dedicated to closely following the Scrum method, through the maintenance of a Scrum board as well as two to three weekly meetings.

### Developed skills

- Android development

- Java/Kotlin programming

- Real-time database interaction

- Teamwork and organisation
